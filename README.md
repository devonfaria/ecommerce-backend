## Installation

To enjoy this application, you will need to install Node JS on your local computer. [Click here for links to download Node JS.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then, clone this repository to your local computer, and open up the folder in your coding software (i.e. Visual Studio Code). Once open, open up your Terminal (on Mac OS) or GitBash (on Windows OS). You will have to direct yourself to the cloned repository, and then run this command in the terminal: 

`npm install`

This will download the node modules MySQL, Express, and Inquirer that this application needs to run on your local computer. After install, you will run the following command to open a MySQL shell in your terminal: 

`mysql -u root` 

Then you will install the schema.sql file so MySQL can format your database. The semi-colon is necessary.

`SOURCE db/schema.sql;`

You can exit the shell by entering:

`exit`

And then type:

```npm start```

If you get a message in the terminal saying "Connected to the emptracker_db database.
Welcome to the Employee Tracker. Please enter an action below.", then you have installed the program correctly.  

The Inquirer module will bring up the main menu of the Employee Tracker. When adding data, simply type your response to each question in the terminal and hit enter. You can navigate menus by pressing the numbers associated with each option and hitting enter.

Even directly after an update, you can immediately see the changes when viewing your lists. Choose 'quit' on the main menu when finished.
